# RMK

Keyboard firmware for cortex-m, with layer/dynamic keymap/[vial](https://get.vial.today) support, written in Rust.

## Checklist after generating the firmware project

- [X] Update `memory.x` for your microcontroller(if needed)

- [X] Create your `vial.json` by your layout: https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-via.html, replace the default one

- [ ] Update your default keymap at `src/keymap.rs`

- [ ] Update USB interrupt binding at `src/main.rs`(if needed)

- [ ] Check the chip name of `probe-rs` is right, if you don't use `cargo run`, you can skip this step

## For BLE only

To use NRF BLE, you should have [nrf s140 softdevice 7.3.0](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/s140/download) flashed to nrf52840 first. 

The following are the detailed steps:

1. Erase the flash:
   ```shell
   probe-rs erase --chip nrf52840_xxAA
   ```
2. Flash softdevice firmware to flash:
   ```shell
   probe-rs download --verify --format hex --chip nRF52840_xxAA s140_nrf52_7.3.0_softdevice.hex
   ```
3. Compile, flash and run the example
   ```shell
   cargo run --release
   ```
